# Primates

### Build the website locally

Primates is meant to be so simple to use that you can do it all within the browser. However, if you'd like to develop locally on your own machine, that's possible too if you're comfortable with command line. Follow these simple steps set that up with Docker:

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

2. Clone your repository locally.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StanGirard/Primates.git
    ```

3. Run the following shell commands to build the docker image and start the container for the first time:

    ```bash
    cd <repository_folder>
    docker build -t primates "$PWD"
    docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --name primates -v "$PWD":/srv/jekyll primates
    ```


Now that Docker is set up, you do not need to run the above steps again. You can now view your website at http://localhost:4000/. You can start the container again in the future with:

```bash
docker start primates
```

And you can stop the server with:

```bash
docker stop primates
```

Whenever you make any changes to `_config.yml`, you must stop and re-start the server for the new config settings to take effect.

### RSS feed

Primates automatically generates a simple RSS feed of your blog posts, to allow others to subscribe to your posts.  If you want to add a link to your RSS feed in the footer of every page, find the `rss: false` line in `_config.yml` and change it to `rss: true`.

### Page types

- **post** - To write a blog post, add a markdown or HTML file in the `_posts` folder. As long as you give it YAML front matter (the two lines of three dashes), it will automatically be rendered like a blog post. Look at the existing blog post files to see examples of how to use YAML parameters in blog posts.
- **page** - Any page outside the `_posts` folder that uses YAML front matter will have a very similar style to blog posts.
- **minimal** - If you want to create a page with minimal styling (ie. without the bulky navigation bar and footer), assign `layout: minimal` to the YAML front matter.
- If you want to completely bypass the template engine and just write your own HTML page, simply omit the YAML front matter. Only do this if you know how to write HTML!

### YAML front matter parameters

These are the main parameters you can place inside a page's YAML front matter that **Primates** supports.

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
title       | Page or blog post title
subtitle    | Short description of page or blog post that goes under the title
tags        | List of tags to categorize the post. Separate the tags with commas and place them inside square brackets. Example: `[personal, self help, finance]`
bigimg      | Include a large full-width image at the top of the page.  You can either give the path to a single image, or provide a list of images to cycle through
comments    | If you want do add comments to a specific page, use `comments: true`. Comments are automatically enabled on blog posts; to turn comments off for a specific post, use `comments: false`. Comments only work if you enable at least one provider(diqus, staticman, just-comments) in `_config.yml` file.
show-avatar | If you have an avatar configured in the `_config.yml` but you want to turn it off on a specific page, use `show-avatar: false`. If you want to turn it off by default, locate the line `show-avatar: true` in the file `_config.yml` and change the `true` to `false`; then you can selectively turn it on in specific pages using `show-avatar: true`.
image       | If you want to add a personalized image to your blog post that will show up next to the post's excerpt and on the post itself, use `image: /path/to/img`.
share-img   | If you want to specify an image to use when sharing the page on Facebook or Twitter, then provide the image's full URL here.
social-share | If you don't want to show buttons to share a blog post on social media, use `social-share: false` (this feature is turned on by default).
use-site-title | If you want to use the site title rather than page title as HTML document title (ie. browser tab title), use `use-site-title: true`. When set, the document title will take the format `Site Title - Site Description` (eg. `My website - A virtual proof that name is awesome!`). By default, it will use `Page Title` if it exists, or `Site Title` otherwise.
layout      | What type of page this is (default is `post` for blog posts and `page` for other pages. You can use `minimal` if you don't want a header and footer)
js          | List of local JavaScript files to include in the page (eg. `/js/mypage.js`)
ext-js      | List of external JavaScript files to include in the page (eg. `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.2/underscore-min.js`). External JavaScript files that support [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) can be specified using the `href` and `sri` parameters eg.<br/>`href: "//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"`<br/>`sri: "sha256-hVVnYaiADRTO2PzUGmuLJr8BLUSjGIZsDYGmIJLv2b8="`
css         | List of local CSS files to include in the page
ext-css      | List of external CSS files to include in the page. External CSS files using SRI (see `ext-js` parameter) are also supported.
googlefonts | List of Google fonts to include in the page (eg. `["Monoton", "Lobster"]`)
gh-repo   | If you want to show GitHub buttons at the top of a post, this sets the GitHub repo name (eg. `StanGirard/Primates`). You must also use the `gh-badge` parameter to specify what buttons to show.
gh-badge  | Select which GitHub buttons to display, available options are: [star, watch, fork, follow]. You must also use the `gh-repo` parameter to specify the GitHub repo.
